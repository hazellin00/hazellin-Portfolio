          As long as I can remember, I’ve been drawn to the backstage – the quiet
          chaos that makes a show feel effortless to the audience.

          Working with <strong>FCU Musical Theatre</strong> let me blend
          <strong>marketing, logistics, and experience design</strong> – from
          promotions to the moment the curtain fell.

          Audience members remember the songs and the spotlight. But the
          <em>emotional core</em> of a show often happens in the wings:
          quick eye contact between cast members, last-minute mic checks,
          or the moment everyone takes a deep breath before the opening note.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this production, I documented not only the performance, but also
          the <strong>timelines, checklists, and communications</strong> that
          held everything together. This post is part memory, part playbook for
          future student teams.

          Every production starts long before opening night. For FCU Musical
          Theatre, it began with a simple question: <em>What story do we want
          to tell, and who do we want to invite into it?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          My role mixed <strong>marketing strategy</strong> with
          <strong>logistics</strong>. I helped translate creative ideas into a
          roadmap: campaign milestones, rehearsal schedules, content pieces,
          and internal updates that kept everyone aligned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Promotion wasn’t just about posters. It meant understanding
          <strong>which channels students actually check</strong>, what would
          make them pause, and how to keep them engaged from first teaser to
          ticket purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          On show days, that work shifted into operations: checking call times,
          confirming cues with tech, and making sure performers had what they
          needed to focus on their roles instead of logistics.
